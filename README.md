# climapredict-weather-monitoring-system
This IoT-based Weather Monitoring System collects real-time climate data using Raspberry Pi and multiple sensors. It uses Machine Learning to analyze 34 days of past weather data and predict future conditions. The system functions offline (without internet), making it suitable for remote locations.  
# ðŸŒ¦ Weather Monitoring System  

ðŸ“Œ *Project Description:*  
This *IoT-based Weather Monitoring System* collects real-time climate data using sensors and analyzes historical weather trends using *Machine Learning. The system operates **offline* (without internet), making it suitable for remote locations.  

ðŸš€ *Key Features:*  
- *Real-time weather tracking* using Raspberry Pi and multiple sensors  
- *ML-based prediction* using past 34 daysâ€™ weather data  
- *Offline functionality* (does not require internet)  
- *Climate condition detection* (rain, thunderstorms, temperature, humidity, etc.)  
- *Local data storage & analysis*  

ðŸ›  *Technologies Used:*  
- *Hardware:* Raspberry Pi, Rain Sensor, Temperature & Humidity Sensor, Thunderstorm Detector  
- *Software:* Python, Machine Learning, Data Analysis  
- *ML Model:* Weather pattern prediction based on historical data  

ðŸ“Š *How It Works:*  
1. *Data Collection*: Sensors measure temperature, humidity, rainfall, and storm conditions.  
2. *Data Storage*: Up to 34 days of data is stored for pattern analysis.  
3. *Machine Learning Analysis*: The system predicts upcoming weather conditions using historical trends.  
4. *Alerts & Monitoring*: Detects extreme weather conditions and providesÂ localÂ alerts.
